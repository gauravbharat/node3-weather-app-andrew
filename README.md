# node3-weather-app-andrew
Weather app created from Andrew Mead's "Advanced Nodejs 3" course. This app gave an insight on static assets, dynamic assets, using nodejs, express, some advanced ES6 features, API fetch, JSON HTTP endpoint, templates, SSH keys, git, github, heroku and much more.

PORT and API access keys:
You would need to create a local .env file or provide your values, for the PORT value used in src/app.js and for the API access keys used for the mapbox.com (src/utils/geocode.js) and the weatherstack.com (src/utils/forecast.js) API calls.
